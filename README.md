# Sajjad Algburi's Portfolio

## Description

For this project, I had to create a portfolio from scratch! Yes, from scratch, which was probably the hardest thing I have encountered in my coding career. However, as an ambitious person, difficult times like this make me work harder. I have accumulated many skills, including making media queries in CSS, using display flex properties, wireframing, and much more. Although this project took me a considerable amount of time, I have to say, despite the challenge, I loved working on it. Making mistakes and then solving them is what is going to make me the best version of myself.
